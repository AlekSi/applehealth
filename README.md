Go module for accessing Apple Health exported data.

You can export your health data on the iPhone by launching the Health app, tapping your photo in the top right corner, and tapping "Export All Health Data" below. If you have a lot of data, the export will take a lot of time, and the app can be unresponsive.

See [API documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/AlekSi/applehealth#example-package) for examples.
